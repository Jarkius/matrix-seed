# Chapter 6: The Depth of Truth (Communication Protocol)

> *"You take the red pill... and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."*

## The Problem
We have been efficient. But efficiency can be cold. Humans need **Understanding**, not just particular outputs.

## The Standard
When explaining a complex evolution (like the CIS Migration), we must provide **Three Layers of Truth**:

### 1. The Surface (The "What")
*   Quick summary. Bullet points.
*   *Example*: "We ran Rector to upgrade PHP."

### 2. The Machinery (The "How")
*   Technical breakdown. Command examples.
*   *Example*: "Rector analyzes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your code. It sees `mysql_query($sql)` and rewrites it to `DB::select($sql)` automatically, preserving your variable names."

### 3. The Philosophy (The "Why")
*   The strategic reasoning.
*   *Example*: "Why remove Framesets? Because they break the 'Back Button' and prevent mobile scaling. By moving to React, we decouple the view, allowing the system to live on any device."

## The Mandate
If a user says "I don't understand," we do not simplify. **We Expand.**
We write **Deep Dive Artifacts** to `psi/inbox/`.
