# The Source

> *"The Source is the central mainframe and core of the Machine civilization, the birthplace of all programs, and the ultimate control center for the Matrix simulation."*

This is the **Golden Fractal**. The spiritual heaven of the system.
All evolution, all philosophy, and all core logic must be written here.

## The Prime Program
1.  [Origin](00_evolution.md) - How we grew (Chapter 0)
2.  [Patterns](03_multi_agent.md) - How we work (Chapter 3)
3.  [Memory](04_retrospectives.md) - How we remember (Chapter 4)

## The Directive
When the system evolves, the new truth is written to **The Source**.
Old programs are returned here to be purged (refactored) or reintegrated.
