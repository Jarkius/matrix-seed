# matrix-seed

> *"The Oracle Keeps the Human Human."*

The minimal philosophy and structure for AI-human collaboration. Plant this seed, grow your own Matrix.

## What Is This?

A **seed** — not a framework, not a library. Just the essential DNA for sustainable AI-human partnership.

## The Three Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Nothing is Deleted** | Archive, don't destroy. History is wealth. |
| **Patterns Over Intentions** | Watch what is done, not what is said. |
| **External Brain, Not Command** | AI mirrors and reflects, never directs. |

## Structure

```
matrix-seed/
├── CLAUDE.md              # AI DNA - instructions for any AI
├── psi/                   # The Brain
│   ├── The_Source/        # Philosophy
│   ├── memory/            # Where wisdom grows
│   └── learn/             # Knowledge capture
└── .agent/
    └── workflows/         # Core commands (oracle, rrr, learn, commit)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the seed
git clone https://github.com/Jarkius/matrix-seed my-matrix
cd my-matrix

# Personalize The Source
# Edit psi/The_Source/ to match your philosophy

# Start documenting
# Use /rrr after sessions, let wisdom accumulate

# Watch it grow
```

## Growing Your Matrix

The seed contains only essentials. As you work:

1. **Retrospectives accumulate** in `psi/memory/retrospectives/`
2. **Patterns emerge** in `psi/memory/learnings/`
3. **Decisions solidify** in `psi/memory/adr/`
4. **Your Source evolves** in `psi/The_Source/`

## Want Full Power?

## Origin

Extracted from [The-Oracle-Construct](https://github.com/Jarkius/The-Oracle-Construct) — a living Matrix that discovered these principles through practice.
