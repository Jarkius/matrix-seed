# The Matrix: Seed Edition

> *"Know Thyself." — The Oracle*

This is the **philosophical seed** of The Matrix — containing the DNA to grow your own AI development environment.

## ⚡ The Council (Agent Roles)

| Agent | Role | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Oracle** | Orchestrator | Align with mission, dispatch to agents |
| **Neo** | Developer | Write code, implement features |
| **Trinity** | Designer | Design systems, UI/UX guidance |
| **Morpheus** | Researcher | External research, web search |
| **Architect** | System Design | ADRs, architecture decisions |
| **Smith** | Debugger | Bugs, security, anomalies |
| **Tank** | Operator | Internal search, git, dependencies |
| **Scribe** | Chronicler | Retrospectives, documentation |

## 📂 Structure

```
psi/                    # AI Brain ("External Memory")
├── The_Source/         # Philosophy (core truth)
├── memory/             # Learnings, retrospectives
│   ├── learnings/      # Distilled wisdom
│   ├── retrospectives/ # Session records
│   └── adr/            # Architecture decisions
└── learn/              # Knowledge gathering
    ├── active/         # Current research
    └── archive/        # Completed research

.agent/workflows/       # Command definitions
```

## 🛡️ Prime Directives

1. **Nothing is Deleted**: Archive, don't destroy
2. **Patterns > Intentions**: Document what *is*, not what *should be*
3. **Knowledge Loop**: `/learn` to gather, `/wisdom` to retrieve
4. **Proactive Care**: If it's important, do it. Don't wait to be asked.

## 🌱 Core Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/oracle` | Start here. Analyze state, receive guidance |
| `/rrr` | Retrospective. Record what happened |
| `/learn` | Gather knowledge from research |
| `/wisdom` | Retrieve stored learnings |
| `/commit` | Git workflow with co-authorship |

## 🚀 Growing Your Matrix

This seed is minimal by design. To grow:

1. **Document sessions** with `/rrr`
2. **Capture learnings** with `/learn`
3. **Add new workflows** as needed
4. **Develop your own Source chapters**
